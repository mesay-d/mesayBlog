framework for building scalable and maintainable web applications.","isFeatured":true,"content":"\n# What is Angular?\n\nAngular is a **TypeScript-based open-source front-end framework** developed by Google.  \nIt is used to build **dynamic single-page applications (SPAs)** with a component-based architecture.\n\n# Why We Use Angular\n\nAngular provides several advantages for web development:\n\n- **Component-Based Architecture** – Reusable UI components make apps modular and maintainable.  \n- **Two-Way Data Binding** – Synchronizes the model and view automatically.  \n- **Dependency Injection** – Simplifies service management and testing.  \n- **Built-in Routing** – Easy navigation between views in single-page applications.  \n- **Strong Typing with TypeScript** – Catches errors at compile-time rather than runtime.  \n- **Extensive Ecosystem** – RxJS for reactive programming, Angular CLI for scaffolding, and official libraries for forms, HTTP, and more.\n\n# What is Unique About Angular?\n\n- It is a **full-fledged framework** (not just a library like React) with everything needed to build large-scale applications.  \n- Uses **TypeScript natively** for type safety and better tooling.  \n- Built-in **dependency injection** system improves modularity and testability.  \n- Supports **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation** for faster rendering in production.  \n- Officially backed and maintained by **Google**.\n\n# Summary\n\nAngular is ideal for developers building **large, complex, maintainable SPAs**.  \nIt combines the power of TypeScript, RxJS, and a component-based architecture to create modern web apps.\n## What Makes Angular Unique?\n\nAngular stands out from other frameworks because of:\n\n1. **Comprehensive Framework** – Unlike libraries (like React), Angular is a complete solution with routing, forms, HTTP services, and state management out of the box.\n2. **Powerful Router** – Advanced **routing with lazy loading**, route guards, and preloading strategies for optimized performance.\n3. **Dependency Injection System** – Makes services and state management scalable and testable.\n4. **Built-in RxJS Integration** – Reactive programming at its core for handling asynchronous data streams.\n5. **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation** – Improves performance by compiling templates before runtime.\n6. **Enterprise-Level Features** – Perfect for
